	Hi, my name is Whatever You Want It To Be and I want introduce you to the most up to date coding platform which is called The Brain. It runs on every operating system, may it be United States of America and Sh'iah Contry of Iraq and Syria. Every system has it's own requirements and many are incmpatible with each other making coding a pain in the ass. I bet that your grandpa or even a great great great father of your country did it in his sleep, when he was that bright like you are reading up to this very sentence, he did it in sunlight. You would like to try it right now. You would like to code facebook right in glimpse of an eye, but tell me why we need another one? There is an internet shop in every country, there is no internet for some others or even a smartphone, so how would you like to code it? Then you must be smart, how would you do it? Born in some rich family, or go to the easiest collage to stand out in the crowd, whatever it is you're not the coder until you will learn to live without it. You think why you shoul code when there is nothing to it? Then my very best question is why not? You think that everything you do don't have any consequencies and you're free of obligations doing what you do. You're an engineer, maybe have masters and you're thinking about phd... WTF? Did you do something for your mother last week or even month? Yes, maybe you're better in doing good than me, but still you're not a coder, still not the. You hope to get out on few beers and kill the laughs or the other way, tell me then how you are doing that every thing you call coding? To tell you the truth you are coded all the way to this very bottom.
