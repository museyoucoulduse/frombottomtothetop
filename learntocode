	Hi, my name is Whatever You Want It To Be and I want introduce you to the most up to date coding platform which is called The Brain. It runs on every operating system, may it be United States of America and Sh'iah Contry of Iraq and Syria. Every system has it's own requirements and many are incompatible with each other making coding a pain in the ass. I bet that your grandpa or even a great great great father of your country did it in his sleep, when he was that bright like you are reading up to this very sentence, he did it in sunlight. You would like to try it right now. You would like to code facebook right in glimpse of an eye, but tell me why we need another one? There is an internet shop in every country, there is no internet for some others or even a smartphone, so how would you like to code it? Then you must be smart, how would you do it? Born in some rich family, or go to the easiest collage to stand out in the crowd, whatever it is you're not the coder until you will learn to live without it. You think why you shoul code when there is nothing to it? Then my very best question is why not? You think that everything you do don't have any consequencies and you're free of obligations doing what you do. You're an engineer, maybe have masters and you're thinking about phd... WTF? Did you do something for your mother last week or even month? Yes, maybe you're better in doing good than me, but still you're not a coder, still not the. You hope to get out on few beers and kill the laughs or the other way, tell me then how you are doing that every thing you call coding? To tell you the truth you are coded all the way to this very bottom.
	After the short introduction there is time to get to the design phase. To tell you the truth it's the easiest part of coding, because there is no need to code, and all you do is not coding at this very moment, thus you are designing or if you code all the way to this point it's that time when you think about your code and redesign it to be somewhat useful for others, or for you, which is the way of coding. You have to design everything, reverse engineer every aspect which interfere with your code, to be able to code your way out of the box of others peoples code. To tell you the truth every one who can code, code against you, so you have to be able to code against someone else or even against yourself to get the other coders inside your trap so they code for you. You should think if it is that you want to do, don't code and claim the code for yourself. Are you that strong? If you really want to know, it's very hard to cope with people claiming everything you did yourself is theirs, but after all who cares? If it's useful and free and even you, yourself can or could use it, why not? It's not the question for everybody elso not coding themself the solution if this solution should be for free or fully open source? Then if you have some time you could code another solution for existing solution making it closed source and paid, but should you work for this kind of company or developers network. Maybe you're not that smart after all charging people money for solution you didn't design or code but which is essential for the usefulness of your added solution. Then there is no question about a design, why? It's just a matter of taste.
	I don't mean to sound crazy, but as you know it's easy to have many identities over the net, and even in real world out there, especially there. You could write down every piece of paper you got, but will it work that good for you as it did with not working hard on somone else behalf. I think it's easier for me. No one actually knows how, why or when, not mentioning who, all they want is to get by to the very end of it. It is written in some textbook, or other very important book, or maybe in many of them. Why it's like that? Why I try to chenge it? Maybe I'm making people happy against their own will and it's me who should be blamed for trying to change the world, when noone cares. I'm not sure if I do? I feel like from a book about the scientist and devil, and still I don't know which one I am. Maybe I'm both... That's the coding phase apogeum, phase full of distractions, when you have to repeat your thoughts like meditation mantra to be able to compile or interpret things you want to be compiled or interpreted by computer system called commonly the Human, the one with the shortest story about him or her. He don't care, he want to party, he don't think, he use his mind like a tape, playing and recording his thoughts, but they are no lonnger his, they belong to sombody else when they are recorderd and they belong to somebody else when they are played. Tell me please how would you like to own something, or earn something when everything you do is not yours? How would you get out of this kind of contradiction? Can you ride with it all the way long from the operating system phase, to the design phase, up the way to coding phase, leaving everything in production to somebody else? Are you that strong to be the real devops?
	Somwhere in European Union under no working government, it's about to shock. Starting: The Brain, biggest thing on earth; The Human, good worker of Brain's company; System, an abstraction working for noone, very treatearos, sometimes good for brain, sometimes good for human, rarely both, often bad for two of them, but it has power which none Human or Brain alone can fight with.
	Brain - What to do? There is so many things I can, and I can't choose one to focus on. Halp maybe?
	Human - Why you need help? You got me, I can do anything you want, we could start with a research, then draw a table with pros and cons and we'll be good.
	System - No you will not do that. You have to read carefully the notes people before you have wrote down, and then you will choose your carieer path, starting in some of the local collages or better universities. You will choose, what you're told and have no objections, because we long ago have decided where we're heading and you will not change the course of Human and Brain. Understand?
	Human - Yes, sir!
	Brain - No way, you piece of shit! I will never do what I am told, not before I calculate what's good for me and only me, I am my only master, and Human is working for me, not for you!
	Human - But mr. Brain, we have an opportunity to have a good life, find a way to the money and stuff, we deserve it! We can do this! You know mr. Brain that we are good for people, we can do much goodnes, as we will go along our life, and we will be remembere for long ahead by our childrens, and their friends and we will have respect. That's the way the System works, we will know what's good for us because we were told so, we don't have to question anything, just take and be thankfull for gracefullness of System and all the unknown ways how it works, we could have a living, and do this and that, I don't even know what it could be, I can't think of it right now, but e could do all of this!
	Brain - You're delusional, you don't know what you're talking about, all you take for the future is some words without any evidence. Did the System told us what our future will be? I want to have endorfins, serotonine and dopamine not some lies behind which there is only poropaganda of success without any tale about that who faild in their mission to accomplish someones else goals written long ago by some monk in a fucking monastery! How could he know what's good for us? He didn't lived in today's world to tell me, the master of my life, how should I work, how, should I live, what to love and what to hate? Is there any evidence that what System is saying is actually true? Maybe it's not that one monk, maybe is't a management request to do something for them, or the club of marketing gurus thinking they could sell anything to anyone using only the System as their messanger. You don't know any of that, so how could you choose what's good for you, and for your children, when there is no businessplan, or a prospect you coudl read to know exactly what steps you will have to take to accomplish your orders given to you by the System itself, not your real boss, me, The Brain!
