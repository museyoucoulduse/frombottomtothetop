	Hi, my name is Whatever You Want It To Be and I want introduce you to the most up to date coding platform which is called The Brain. It runs on every operating system, may it be United States of America and Sh'iah Contry of Iraq and Syria. Every system has it's own requirements and many are incompatible with each other making coding a pain in the ass. I bet that your grandpa or even a great great great father of your country did it in his sleep, when he was that bright like you are reading up to this very sentence, he did it in sunlight. You would like to try it right now. You would like to code facebook right in glimpse of an eye, but tell me why we need another one? There is an internet shop in every country, there is no internet for some others or even a smartphone, so how would you like to code it? Then you must be smart, how would you do it? Born in some rich family, or go to the easiest collage to stand out in the crowd, whatever it is you're not the coder until you will learn to live without it. You think why you shoul code when there is nothing to it? Then my very best question is why not? You think that everything you do don't have any consequencies and you're free of obligations doing what you do. You're an engineer, maybe have masters and you're thinking about phd... WTF? Did you do something for your mother last week or even month? Yes, maybe you're better in doing good than me, but still you're not a coder, still not the. You hope to get out on few beers and kill the laughs or the other way, tell me then how you are doing that every thing you call coding? To tell you the truth you are coded all the way to this very bottom.
	After the short introduction there is time to get to the design phase. To tell you the truth it's the easiest part of coding, because there is no need to code, and all you do is not coding at this very moment, thus you are designing or if you code all the way to this point it's that time when you think about your code and redesign it to be somewhat useful for others, or for you, which is the way of coding. You have to design everything, reverse engineer every aspect which interfere with your code, to be able to code your way out of the box of others peoples code. To tell you the truth every one who can code, code against you, so you have to be able to code against someone else or even against yourself to get the other coders inside your trap so they code for you. You should think if it is that you want to do, don't code and claim the code for yourself. Are you that strong? If you really want to know, it's very hard to cope with people claiming everything you did yourself is theirs, but after all who cares? If it's useful and free and even you, yourself can or could use it, why not? It's not the question for everybody elso not coding themself the solution if this solution should be for free or fully open source? Then if you have some time you could code another solution for existing solution making it closed source and paid, but should you work for this kind of company or developers network. Maybe you're not that smart after all charging people money for solution you didn't design or code but which is essential for the usefulness of your added solution. Then there is no question about a design, why? It's just a matter of taste.
